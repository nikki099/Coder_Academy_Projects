    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A young couple wishes to explore the current house market in 10 South Eastern Brisbane suburbs (Kuraby, Eight Mile Plains, Wishart, Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Upper Mount Gravatt, Algester, Runcorn, Calamvale, Coopers Plains). \n",
    "\n",
    "They plan to buy a 3 or 4 bedroom house in one of the suburbs next year to settle in.\n",
    "However, according to REA suburb profile data, all 10 selected suburbs are in high demand with over [avg 721 visits per property)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GCMlrLKh1r2LKZd7um9AV-tSdW9E4FttNrfEBxh02dc/edit?usp=sharing). \n",
    "\n",
    "As they've already purchased a house in the north side of Brisbane, they wish to find a house with a price around high 500K - mid 600K, which they can afford in the selected suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to provide the couple with a better understanding to the current house price in those areas by exploring the number of houses sold and the median house prices across 10 suburbs over the last 4 years (2017-2020), so they can be more confident in picking 3-4 ideal suburbs to explore their future homes in 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "This project collected 4 sets of data for analysis purpose:\n",

    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> Collect the high-level, suburb based median house prices from REA sites for preliminary assessement </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read Jason file from REA API and create a dataframe\n",
    "I first pulled the house median sold price data for each suburb from a json file via REA API, then converted the suburb and its house median price data into 10 dataframes (1 dataframe per suburbs). Next, I used a loop and pd.concat() function to combine the 10 suburbs data into a single dataframe (df_houses).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excludes all unrelated data, fill the null values and update the data types\n",
    "As the couple is most interested in houses with 3-4 bedrooms, the df_houses dataframe has excluded units, also houses with less 3 bedrooms. In addition, I filled all null values with zero, and updated the fields types to correct data types using dict and apply() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the result, the final dataframe (df_rea_data) only contains the median sold price for All Houses, 3-bedroom, 4-bedroom and 5+bedrooms from the selected suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-REA dataframe preview\n",
    "  ![REA_dataframe_preview](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/data_cleaning_REA_data_preview.PNG?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> Collect the high-level, suburb based median house prices from Domain sites for preliminary assessment </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike **REA** (https://www.realestate.com.au), where the median price can be accessed directly from the page or API, **Domain.com.au** (https://www.domain.com.au) shows some of the detailed property data (such as yearly median price trend) in a folded menu, which is more difficult and time consuming to scrape using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence I used a web scraping tool to obtain the property data only from 10 suburbs to speed up the process and the scraped data in a csv file ([domain_market_trend.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp3Ufrkx_YNkrzFG0Fo8glmVHHkjc6rOXsNbw13BJds/edit#gid=1947210351))\n",
    "- Drop the missing and irrelevant data\n",
    "After importing the domain median summary data and read as a dataframe, I dropped any rows where the \n",
    "\"Median price\", \"Avg days on market\", and \"Clearance rate\" are missing, also dropped data for Units and Houses with less 3 or greater than 5 as the couple is only interested in 3-4 bedroom houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove extra text from price and days fields and convert the string data into numerical type \n",
    "I used the techniques learned from the Airbnb data cleaning lessons to remove the dollar $, texts such as days from the selected columns, then converted these cols into numeric values using digits module,  remove_puncs(), defaultfict() and df.assign (**numeric_cols) functions to create a new dataframe (df_domain_data).\n",

    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> Collect the Traffic and Overall Domain Rating data from both REA  and Domain sites for comparison </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a quick check on the median house prices collected from REA and Domain, I noticed there's a big difference between the median sold price for Runcorn (3 bedroom house) from these 2 sites.  For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   REA | Runcorn | House | 3 Bedrooms | Median House Price - 550K  \n",
    "    -   Domain | Runcorn | House |3 Bedrooms | Median House Price - 455K  \n",
    "    \n",
    "So I went on comparing the median sold price differences between REA and Domain for houses (w/ 3-4 bedrooms),  and found out that:\n",
    "      - In general, the median house price on REA is much higher than Domain price\n",
    "     - Also, Domain don't have median price data for 4 suburbs (calamvale, coopers plains and eight mile plans, kuraby) \n",
    "     - See the bar chart below for an example of the price difference between REA and Domain for 4-beds House\n",
    "     (each bar represents the value of REA median price minus Domain median price in each suburb)\n",
    "![median_price_diff](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/data_cleaning_price_diff.png?raw=true)\n",
    "This made me wonder which site I should rely on for further house price trend analysis. To find a better answer to my question, I further compared the web traffic data (using SEMRUSH) and overall domain rating (from Canstar).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Traffic Analysis Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic Comparison (0-REA,1-Domain)![edomain_traffic](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/data_cleaning_Domain_traffic.PNG?raw=true)\n",
    "- By comparing the web traffic KPIs, I can see REA (realestate.com.au) has 8X more traffic than Domain by Visits.\n",
    "- REA also has 2X more traffic than Domain by Unique Visitors.\n",
    "- Though Domain has slightly higher Avg. Visit Duration length (12 mins) than REA (10 mins), REA showed much lower bounce rate (38%) than Domain (54%). This indicates visitors are more likely to stay around and view more than 1 pages on REA.\n",

    "**Overall Domain Rating Comparison**\n",
    "![domain_rating](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/data_cleaning_Domain_rating.PNG?raw=true)\n",

    "- REA - total score : 29 | Domain - total score: 24\n",
    "- REA led the rating in 5 out of 6 categories (Overall satisfaction, Overall satisfaction, Range of properties, Ease of site navigation, Quality of information available and Tools and calculators)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**In summary**<br>\n",
    "-REA has much stronger traffic and also better user engagement than Domain.\n",
    "-REA also has a higher overall performance rating than Domain.\n",
    "-Based on the comparisons from web traffic and overall site performance overview of 2 sites, it's clear that **REA** is the site that I'd go to scrap the property listing  data of the 10 suburbs as the next step.\n",

    "   - Fix the remained \"Price\" and \"Size\" column issues:\n",
    "        - For example, the price value is too low ($407) or too high.\n",
    "        - Some of the house size was < 2 square meters (m2), because they were measured in HA (Hectare).\n",
    "        - Some of the property listed as House but the size showed and address info showed they are actually Townhouses.\n",

    "\n",
    "By comparing the 3 and 4 bedroom median house price vs Sold# trend over the last 4 years, I observed these 6 trend patterns (shown above):\n",
    "\n",
    "A - Median price is moving up over the time, while sold houses # is going down\n",
    "    - This may indicate the market demand is higher than the supply in an area. It's a seller's market.\n",
    "    \n",
    "B - Median price is moving down over the time, while sold houses # is going up\n",
    "    - This may indicate the market demand is lower than the supply in an area. It's a buyer's market. \n",
    "    \n",
    "C - Median price sees a sharp drop over the time, while sold houses # is also going downward.\n",
    "    - This may indicate the supply is down, and the demand for houses has dropped even more in an area. \n",
    "    \n",
    "D - Median price and sold houses # are both going up over the time.\n",
    "    - This may indicate the demand and supply for houses are both going strong in an area. \n",
    "    \n",
    "E - Median price remains stable over the time, while sold houses # is going down.\n",
    "    - This may indicate the demand and supply are both going down, but the houses are holding their values in that area.\n",
    "    \n",
    "F - Median price and sold houses # are both stable over the time.\n",
    "    - This may indicate the demand and supply are both flat, no major changes in the house demand and values.\n",
    "        \n",
    "<font color=red>**Note:**</font> this is only a preliminary inference by observing the trend with limited sets of data, and will need to examine further factors (such as the number of houses on sale, the average days on the market, the council development plan, investment policies etc.) to make a proper conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=#3498DB>**3 bedroom houses:([trend_line](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/3_bed_trend.PNG))**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pattern A - Demand > Supply, house price is likely to continue to rise, competition is high (**Coopers Plains, Runcorn and Calamvale**)\n",
    "- Pattern B - Supply < Demand, house price may drop slightly (**Kuraby, Sunnybank**)\n",
    "- Pattern D - Supply and Demand are both strong - growing buying interests, increasing competition  (**Upper Mt. Gravatt**) \n",
    "- Pattern E - Supply and Demand are both going down, but the price remains high. Most people live in this area are settled and not keen to sell yet (**Sunnybank Hills, Eight Mile Plains, Wishart**)\n",
    "- Pattern F - Supply and Demand are both flat, house price has remained stable (**Algester**)\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>**Note:</font>**\n",
    "Though some suburbs have seen the median price and the number of houses sold going down, **this doesn't necessarily mean these suburbs are not in demand (actually REA suburb profile data indicates all 10 suburbs are in high demand). It may indicate the buyers are more interested in buying a larger house with more bedrooms (such as 4 beds or 5+) in these areas.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=#3498DB>**4 bedroom houses:([trend_line](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/4_bed_trend.PNG))**</font>\n",

    "- Pattern D - Supply and Demand are both strong - growing buying interests, increasing competition (**Upper Mt. Gravatt, Coopers Plains**) \n",

    "#### Q5. Are there any correlations between the house sold price and other factors?\n",
    "Answer: First, I created a scatter plot to check if there's any correlation between the House price vs the Property Size, and the graph seemed to indicate there's a positive correlation between the two, as the larger the Size of the Property, the higher the Sold House Price is.   \n",

    "Next, I decide to calculate the correlation coefficient value among all 6 variables and show in a heat map, so as to gain a better understanding of the possible correlations between the house price and other relevant factors:\n",

    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing the number of sold houses and the median prices of 3 and 4 bedrooms across 10 suburbs between 2017-2020, the following area are likely to see continued high prices in next few years. Because the median price trend didn't vary much in the past 4 years in these suburbs while the number of houses sold have declined but the suburbs are still in high demand:\n",
    "  - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Sunnybank, Wishart, Eight Mile Plains, Upper Mt.Gravatt, Sunnybank Hills</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The couple is recommended to consider exploring houses in the following 5 suburbs:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Kuraby, Coopers Plains, Algester, Calamvale</font>**, which showed a stable or increasing # of houses sold in either 3/4 bedrooms or both, but the median price is still within the affordable range (high 500K - mid 600K) for the couple.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Runcorn</font>**, (a popular suburb adjacent to Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Eight Mile Plains), has started to show a declining number of houses sold since 2019 with an increasing median price for both 3 and 4 bedrooms. This indicates the demand has increased last year, but the median price is still between mid 500K to low 600K for 3 and 4 bedroom houses. Entering this suburb early next year may help to gain benefits from long-term capital growth.\n",
    "   \n",
    " If the family prefers a 3 bed-room house at a lower price **[price](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/3_BED.PNG)**, then watch the new properties coming to the market in the following areas:  \n",
    "   - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Runcorn, Algester, Kuraby, Calamvale (Median price range - 430K - 530K)</font>**<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " If the family prefers a 4 bed-room house at a lower **[price](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/4_BED.PNG)**, then watch the new properties coming to the market in the following areas:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Runcorn, Algester, Calamvale, Coopers Plains (Median price range - 560K - 650K)</font>**<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "Finally, there's a potential for capital growth in Sunnybank if the buyers are willing to convert a 3-bedroom house into a 4-bedroom house in the future. Since there's much more demand for a 4 bedrooms, while the median price for the 3-bedroom house is dropping. \n",
    "   \n",
    "## Follow-up Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the couple make an informed choice, it's recommended to continue exploring the following data to gain a better understanding of the recommended suburbs:\n",
    "   - Demographics (Population, Household Types, Age groups, House Ownerships, Ethnic Communities)\n",
    "   - Distances to local suburbs, shops and public transportations\n",
    "   - Suburb crime reports\n",
