    " - “Finding the Affordable Suburbs to Buy in SE Brisbane Area”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A young couple wishes to explore the current house market in 10 South Eastern Brisbane suburbs (Kuraby, Eight Mile Plains, Wishart, Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Upper Mount Gravatt, Algester, Runcorn, Calamvale, Coopers Plains). \n",
    "\n",
    "They plan to buy a 3 or 4 bedroom house in one of the suburbs next year to settle in.\n",
    "However, according to REA suburb profile data, all 10 selected suburbs are in high demand with over [avg 721 visits per property)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GCMlrLKh1r2LKZd7um9AV-tSdW9E4FttNrfEBxh02dc/edit?usp=sharing). \n",
    "\n",
    "As they've already purchased a house in the north side of Brisbane, they wish to find a house with a price around high 500K - mid 600K, which they can afford in the selected suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to provide the couple with a better understanding to the current house price in those areas by exploring the number of houses sold and the median house prices across 10 suburbs over the last 4 years (2017-2020), so they can be more confident in picking 3-4 ideal suburbs to explore their future homes in 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "This project collected 4 sets of data for analysis purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. REA - Suburb based median house price (summary data)\n",
    " * <font color='#138D75'>This data is used in the data cleaning process.</font> \n",
    " * Direct data access from a Jason file through [REA](https://realestate.com.au) API.\n",

    " * Overall Domain Rating (REA vs Domain) collected from [Canstar](https://www.canstarblue.com.au/stores-services/real-estate-vs-domain/)\n",
    " * Through comparing the summary house median prices, web traffic and overall domain rating data between these 2 sites, the project finally chose REA as the source to explore the detailed sold house listing information for project analysis. \n",
    " * How to access: this data is stored in the excel file “[Traffic_Rating.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XQYlDbTnuqz_YNu0iszhu9sh3PqkX1u9778QthOYeAI/edit?usp=sharing)\" in the [Google Drive “Data” folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12qFycpdnDk8_SrNtqTyAVV8o0O0o-wPf?usp=sharing).\n",

    "## Cleaning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> Collect the high-level, suburb based median house prices from REA sites for preliminary assessement </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read Jason file from REA API and create a dataframe\n",
    "I first pulled the house median sold price data for each suburb from a json file via REA API, then converted the suburb and its house median price data into 10 dataframes (1 dataframe per suburbs). Next, I used a loop and pd.concat() function to combine the 10 suburbs data into a single dataframe (df_houses).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Excludes all unrelated data, fill the null values and update the data types\n",
    "As the couple is most interested in houses with 3-4 bedrooms, the df_houses dataframe has excluded units, also houses with less 3 bedrooms. In addition, I filled all null values with zero, and updated the fields types to correct data types using dict and apply() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the result, the final dataframe (df_rea_data) only contains the median sold price for All Houses, 3-bedroom, 4-bedroom and 5+bedrooms from the selected suburbs.\n",
    " \n",
    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> Collect the high-level, suburb based median house prices from Domain sites for preliminary assessment </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike **REA** (https://www.realestate.com.au), where the median price can be accessed directly from the page or API, **Domain.com.au** (https://www.domain.com.au) shows some of the detailed property data (such as yearly median price trend) in a folded menu, which is more difficult and time consuming to scrape using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence I used a web scraping tool to obtain the property data only from 10 suburbs to speed up the process and the scraped data in a csv file ([domain_market_trend.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp3Ufrkx_YNkrzFG0Fo8glmVHHkjc6rOXsNbw13BJds/edit#gid=1947210351))\n",
    "- Drop the missing and irrelevant data\n",
    "After importing the domain median summary data and read as a dataframe, I dropped any rows where the \n",
    "\"Median price\", \"Avg days on market\", and \"Clearance rate\" are missing, also dropped data for Units and Houses with less 3 or greater than 5 as the couple is only interested in 3-4 bedroom houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove extra text from price and days fields and convert the string data into numerical type \n",
    "I used the techniques learned from the Airbnb data cleaning lessons to remove the dollar $, texts such as days from the selected columns, then converted these cols into numeric values using digits module,  remove_puncs(), defaultfict() and df.assign (**numeric_cols) functions to create a new dataframe (df_domain_data).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the result, the final dataframe (df_domain_data) only contains the median sold price for houses with 3-bedroom, 4-bedroom and 5 bedrooms from the selected suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> Collect the Traffic and Overall Domain Rating data from both REA  and Domain sites for comparison </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a quick check on the median house prices collected from REA and Domain, I noticed there's a big difference between the median sold price for Runcorn (3 bedroom house) from these 2 sites.  For Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   REA | Runcorn | House | 3 Bedrooms | Median House Price - 550K  \n",
    "    -   Domain | Runcorn | House |3 Bedrooms | Median House Price - 455K  \n",
    "    \n",
    "So I went on comparing the median sold price differences between REA and Domain for houses (w/ 3-4 bedrooms),  and found out that:\n",
    "      - In general, the median house price on REA is much higher than Domain price\n",
    "     - Also, Domain don't have median price data for 4 suburbs (calamvale, coopers plains and eight mile plans, kuraby) \n",
    "\n",
    "This made me wonder which site I should rely on for further house price trend analysis. To find a better answer to my question, I further compared the web traffic data (using SEMRUSH) and overall domain rating (from Canstar).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web Traffic Analysis Result**\n",
    "- By comparing the web traffic KPIs, I can see REA (realestate.com.au) has 8X more traffic than Domain by Visits.\n",
    "- REA also has 2X more traffic than Domain by Unique Visitors.\n",
    "- Though Domain has slightly higher Avg. Visit Duration length (12 mins) than REA (10 mins), REA showed much lower bounce rate (38%) than Domain (54%). This indicates visitors are more likely to stay around and view more than 1 pages on REA.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Overall Domain Rating Comparison**\n",
    "  - By comparing the overall site ratings from Canstar, we can see REA (realestate.com.au) outranked Domain by \"Total Score\".\n",
    "- REA - total score : 29 | Domain - total score: 24\n",
    "- REA led the rating in 5 out of 6 categories (Overall satisfaction, Overall satisfaction, Range of properties, Ease of site navigation, Quality of information available and Tools and calculators)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**In summary**\n",
    "-REA has much stronger traffic and also better user engagement than Domain.\n",
    "-REA also has a higher overall performance rating than Domain.\n",
    "-Based on the comparisons from web traffic and overall site performance overview of 2 sites, it's clear that **REA** is the site that I'd go to scrap the property listing  data of the 10 suburbs as the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  <font color='#0366d6'> REA  Sold Property Listing Data Cleaning </font>\n",
    "I used a web scraping tool to obtain the property listing data from the 10 suburbs to speed up the process.\n",
    "The 10 individual suburb sold property raw data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12qFycpdnDk8_SrNtqTyAVV8o0O0o-wPf)\n",
    "(All files are named following this format  \"realestate.com.au_SOLD_[suburb name].csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, I take the following 4 steps to combine the 10 suburb files and merged the data into 1 single dataframe: \n",
    "     - Get a list of filenames (or sheets) using Glob module\n",
    "     - Turn those into a list of dataframes using list comprehension and for loop\n",
    "     - Add the filename as a column to each dataframe by extracting the suburb name from address (the last element)\n",
    "     - Combine the dataframes into one big dataframe (df_all) using pd.concat() function\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, check thE data types, missing values and shape of the dataframe (df_all)\n",
    "- Third, drop all duplicated rows (using df.drop_duplicates())\n",
    "- Fourth, convert the \"Price\" and \"Size\" columns into numeric types using digits module, remove_puncs(), defaultfict() and df.assign (**numeric_cols) functions to create a new dataframe (df_domain_data).\n",
    "   - Fix the remained \"Price\" and \"Size\" column issues:\n",
    "        - For example, the price value is too low ($407) or too high.\n",
    "        - Some of the house size was < 2 square meters (m2), because they were measured in HA (Hectare).\n",
    "        - Some of the property listed as House but the size showed and address info showed they are actually Townhouses.\n",
    "- Fifth, convert column \"Sold_date\" to datetime type, and extract the Year part as a new colunb \"Sold_year\"\n",
    "- Sixth, fill the missing values in any other columns\n",
    "     - 3 columns - 'Agent_logo', 'Agent', 'Agent_photo', we can simply fill the cell with \"unknown\"\n",
    "     - Column - \"Size_unit\" , we know all the landsize was measured by m², so we can fill all missing values with m²\n",
    "     - Column - \"Car_park\", we can fill the missing value with 0, as this is not so important in this case.\n",
    "     - Column - \"Type\" - we see \"Apartment\", \"Unit\" are listed seperately. As we are more interested in House type, let's combined these 2 types into \"Unit\".\n",
    "- Finally, export the cleaned data into a new csv file ([df_all_10.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iIhILDvN8bh42oT4sKpx7B-9ATjbD1CF0CAeOTHci94/edit?usp=sharing)) for analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "I utilized 3 different visualization packages during the analysis process:\n",
    " - Seaborn\n",
    " - Matplotlib\n",
    " - Plotly_express \n",
    "\n",
    "Both Seaborn and Matplotlib are used for creating static charts (such as line charts, bar charts and heatmap), while Plotly_express, which was a wrapper of plotly,  was used to create interactive visualization, such as clickable boxplots, stacked bars, and animated scatter plots.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing the number of sold houses and the median prices of 3 and 4 bedrooms across 10 suburbs between 2017-2020, the following area are likely to see continued high prices in next few years. Because the median price trend didn't vary much in the past 4 years in these subrubs while the number of hourses sold have declined:\n",
    "  - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Sunnybank, Wishart, Eight Mile Plains, Upper Mt.Gravatt, Sunnybank Hills</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The couple is recommended to consider exploring houses in the following 5 suburbs:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Kuraby, Coopers Plains, Algester, Calamvale</font>**, which showed a stable or increasing # of houses sold in either 3/4 bedrooms or both, but the median price is still within the affordable range (high 500K - mid 600K) for the couple.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Runcorn</font>**, (a popular suburb adjacent to Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Eight Mile Plains), has started to show a declining number of houses sold since 2019 with an increasing median price for both 3 and 4 bedrooms. This indicates the demand has increased last year, but the median price is still between mid 500K to low 600K for 3 and 4 bedroom houses. Entering this suburb early next year may help to gain benefits from long-term capital growth.\n",
    "   \n",
    " If the family prefers a 3 bed-room house at a lower price **[price](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/3_BED.PNG)**, then watch the new properties coming to the market in the following areas:  \n",
    "   - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Runcorn, Algester, Kuraby, Calamvale (Median price range - 430K - 530K)</font>**<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " If the family prefers a 4 bed-room house at a lower **[price](https://github.com/nikki099/Misc/blob/main/4_BED.PNG)**, then watch the new properties coming to the market in the following areas:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **<font color='#E74C3C'>Runcorn, Algester, Calamvale, Coopers Plains (Median price range - 560K - 650K)</font>**<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "Finally, there's a potential for capital growth in Sunnybank if the buyers are willing to convert a 3-bedroom house into a 4-bedroom house in the future. Since there's much more demand for a 4 bedrooms, while the median price for the 3-bedroom house is dropping. \n",
    "   \n",
    "## Follow-up Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the couple make an informed choice, it's recommended to continue exploring the following data to gain a better understanding of the recommended suburbs:\n",
    "   - Demographics (Population, Household Types, Age groups, House Ownerships, Ethnic Communities)\n",
    "   - Distances to local suburbs, shops and public transportations\n",
